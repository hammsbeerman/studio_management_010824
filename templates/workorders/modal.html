          <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
          <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
